# WebScrapingForBetting
Punter sports bettors, people that analyze the pre-match stats and, from that, decide the best bet for this game. Most bettors do this by gathering data from websites and putting it in programmed tables that calculate the best bet to do in a match, but, this data transference is exhausting to do with dozens of matches per day.

So, WebScrapingForBetting is a python project that automatically gets the next match's statistics from a selected championship and analyzes it according to the user betting method.
Besides that, it was idealized not only to automate the betting process but also to apply my python knowledge and for learning motivations.
